## Test scripts for GiGL as a project.

This folder is intended for tests at a GiGL *project* level, e.g. lint tests, or "e2e tests".
Unit tests and integration tests should go in their respective directories e.g. Python [unit](../python/tests/unit/) and [integration](../python/tests/integration/) tests.
