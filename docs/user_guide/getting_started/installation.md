# Installation

## Supported Environments

These are the current environments supported by GiGL

| Python | Mac (Arm64) CPU | Linux CPU | Linux CUDA | PyTorch | PyG |
| ------ | --------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------- | --- |
| 3.9    | Partial Support | Supported | 12.1       | 2.5     | 2.5 |

## Install Prerequisites - setting up your dev machine

Below we provide two ways to bootstrap an environment for using and/or developing GiGL

````{dropdown} (Recommended) Developing/experimenting on a GCP cloud instance.
:color: primary

  We will need to create a GCP instance and setup needed pre-requisites to install and use GiGL.

  You can use our `create_dev_instance.py` script to automatically create an instance for you:
  ```bash
    python scripts/create_dev_instance.py
  ```
  Next, ssh into your instance. It will most likely ask you to install gpu drivers, follow instructions and do so.
  Once you install the drivers, make sure to restart the instance once you do so to ensure the the ops agent for monitoring is also working. You may also need to navigate to the GCP compute instance UI, and under the `Observability` tab of your instance click
  the "Install OPS Agent" button under the GPU metrics to ensure the GPU metrics are also being reported.

  Once done, ensure you can run multiarch docker builds by running following command:
  ```
  docker buildx create --driver=docker-container --use
  sudo apt-get install qemu-user-static
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
  ```

````{dropdown} Manual Setup
:color: primary

  1. If on MAC, Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

  2. Install [Conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install):

  3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and the relevant `buildx` drivers (if using old versions of docker):

  Once installed, ensure you can run multiarch docker builds by running following command:

  Linux:
  ```bash
  docker buildx create --driver=docker-container --use
  sudo apt-get install qemu-user-static
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
  ```

  Mac:
  ```bash
  docker buildx create --driver=docker-container --use
  brew install qemu
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
  ```

  4. Ensure you have GNU MAKE v >= 4.4; if not, please upgrade version.
  ```bash
  make --version
  ```

  **Install make on MAC:**
  ```bash
  brew install make
  ```

  Subsequently, you should be able to use `gmake` in all places where we use `make` since brew formula has installed GNU "make" as "gmake".
  See: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make

  **Install make on Linux:**
  ```
  apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y cmake
  ```

  5. Install [gcloud cli](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install):
    - Make sure you are authenticated to use Google Cloud services: `gcloud init` +
      `gcloud auth application-default login`.
    - Make sure you are authenticated to pull Docker images: `gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev`.

## Install GiGL

We are working on making our whls publicly accessible, for the time being you will need to install from source.

There are various ways to use GiGL. The recommended solution is to set up a conda environment and use some handy
commands:

From the root directory:

```bash
make initialize_environment
conda activate gnn
```

This creates a Python 3.9 environment with some basic utilities. Next, to install all user dependencies. Note: The
command below will try its best ot infer your environment and install necessary reqs i.e. if CUDA is available it will
try to install the necessary gpu deps, otherwise it will install cpu deps.

```bash
make install_deps
```

If you *instead* want to contribute and/or extend GiGL. You can install the developer deps which includes some extra
tooling useful for contributions:

```bash
make install_dev_deps
```
