# Examples for Training and Inference using live subgraph sampling

## Homogeneous (CORA)

We use the CORA dataset as an example for sampling against a homogeneous dataset.

`homogeneous_inference.py` is an example inference loop for the CORA dataset.

You can folloow along with `cora.ipynb` to run an e2e GiGL pipeline on the CORA dataset. It will guide you
through running each component: `config_populator` -> `data_preprocessor` -> `trainer` (Soon) -> `inferencer`
