        Args:
            dataset (DistLinkPredictionDataset): The dataset to sample from.
            num_neighbors (List[int] or Dict[Tuple[str, str, str], List[int]]):
                The number of neighbors to sample for each node in each iteration.
                If an entry is set to `-1`, all neighbors will be included.
                In heterogeneous graphs, may also take in a dictionary denoting
                the amount of neighbors to sample for each individual edge type.
            context (deprecated - will be removed soon) (DistributedContext): Distributed context information of the current process.
            local_process_rank (deprecated - will be removed soon) (int): Required if context provided. The local rank of the current process within a node.
            local_process_world_size (deprecated - will be removed soon)(int): Required if context provided. The total number of processes within a node.
            input_nodes (torch.Tensor or Tuple[str, torch.Tensor]): The
                indices of seed nodes to start sampling from.
                It is of type `torch.LongTensor` for homogeneous graphs.
                If set to `None` for homogeneous settings, all nodes will be considered.
                In heterogeneous graphs, this flag must be passed in as a tuple that holds
                the node type and node indices. (default: `None`)
            num_workers (int): How many workers to use (subprocesses to spwan) for
                    distributed neighbor sampling of the current process. (default: ``1``).
            batch_size (int, optional): how many samples per batch to load
                (default: ``1``).
            pin_memory_device (str, optional): The target device that the sampled
                results should be copied to. If set to ``None``, the device is inferred based off of
                (got by ``gigl.distributed.utils.device.get_available_device``). Which uses the
                local_process_rank and torch.cuda.device_count() to assign the device. If cuda is not available,
                the cpu device will be used. (default: ``None``).
            worker_concurrency (int): The max sampling concurrency for each sampling
                worker. Load testing has showed that setting worker_concurrency to 4 yields the best performance
                for sampling. Although, you may whish to explore higher/lower settings when performance tuning.
                (default: `4`).
            channel_size (int or str): The shared-memory buffer size (bytes) allocated
                for the channel. Can be modified for performance tuning; a good starting point is: ``num_workers * 64MB``
                (default: "4GB").
            process_start_gap_seconds (float): Delay between each process for initializing neighbor loader. At large scales,
                it is recommended to set this value to be between 60 and 120 seconds -- otherwise multiple processes may
                attempt to initialize dataloaders at overlapping times, which can cause CPU memory OOM.
            num_cpu_threads (Optional[int]): Number of cpu threads PyTorch should use for CPU training/inference
                neighbor loading; on top of the per process parallelism.
                Defaults to `2` if set to `None` when using cpu training/inference.
            shuffle (bool): Whether to shuffle the input nodes. (default: ``False``).
            drop_last (bool): Whether to drop the last incomplete batch. (default: ``False``).
