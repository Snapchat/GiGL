class DistPartitioner:
    """
    This class is based on GLT's DistRandomPartitioner class (https://github.com/alibaba/graphlearn-for-pytorch/blob/main/graphlearn_torch/python/distributed/dist_random_partitioner.py)
    and has been optimized for better flexibility and memory management. We assume that init_rpc() and init_worker_group have been called to initialize the rpc and context,
    respectively, prior to this class. This class aims to partition homogeneous and heterogeneous input data, such as nodes,
    node features, edges, edge features, and any supervision labels across multiple machines. This class also produces partition books for edges and
    nodes, which are 1-d tensors that indicate which rank each node id and edge id are stored on. For example, the node partition book

    [0, 0, 1, 2]

    Means that node 0 is on rank 0, node 1 is on rank 0, node 2 is on rank 1, and node 3 is on rank 2.

    In this class, node and edge id and feature tensors can be passed in either through the constructor or the public register functions. It is required to have
    registered these tensors to the class prior to partitioning. For optimal memory management, it is recommended that the reference to these large tensors be deleted
    after being registered to the class but before partitioning, as maintaining both original and intermediate tensors can cause OOM concerns. Registering these tensors is available through both the constructor and the register functions to support
    the multiple use ways customers can use partitioning:

    Option 1: User wants to Partition just the nodes of a graph

    ```
    partitioner = DistPartitioner()
    # Customer doesn't have to pass in excessive amounts of parameters to the constructor to partition only nodes
    partitioner.register_nodes(node_ids)
    del node_ids # Del reference to node_ids outside of DistPartitioner to allow memory cleanup within the class
    partitioner.partition_nodes()
    # We may optionally want to call gc.collect() to ensure that any lingering memory is cleaned up, which may happen in cases where only a subset of inputs are partitioned (i.e no feats or labels)
    gc.collect()
    ```

    Option 2: User wants to partition all parts of a graph together and in sequence

    ```
    partitioner = DistPartitioner(node_ids, edge_index, node_features, edge_features, pos_labels, neg_labels)
    # Register is called in the __init__ functions and doesn't need to be called at all outside the class.
    del (
        node_ids,
        edge_index,
        node_features,
        edge_features,
        pos_labels,
        neg_labels
    ) # Del reference to tensors outside of DistPartitioner to allow memory cleanup within the class
    partitioner.partition()
    # We may optionally want to call gc.collect() to ensure that any lingering memory is cleaned up, which may happen in cases where only a subset of inputs are partitioned (i.e no feats or labels)
    gc.collect()
    ```

    The use case for only partitioning one entity through Option 1 may be in cases where we want to further parallelize some of the workload,
    since the previous GLT use case only had access to Partition() which calls partitioning of entities in sequence.

    For optimal memory management, it is recommended that the reference to these large tensors be deleted
    after being registered to the class but before partitioning, as maintaining both original and intermediate tensors can cause OOM concerns.

    Once all desired tensors are registered, you can either call the `partition` function to partition all registered fields or partition each field individually
    through the public `partition_{entity_type}` functions. With the `partition` function, fields which are not registered will return `None`. Note that each entity type
    should only be partitioned once, since registered fields are cleaned up after partitioning for optimal memory impact.

    From GLT's description of DistRandomPartitioner:
        Each distributed partitioner will process a part of the full graph and feature data, and partition them. A distributed partitioner's
        rank is corresponding to a partition index, and the number of all distributed partitioners must be same with the number of output partitions. During
        partitioning, the partitioned results will be sent to other distributed partitioners according to their ranks. After partitioning, each distributed
        partitioner will own a partitioned graph with its corresponding rank and further save the partitioned results into the local output directory.
