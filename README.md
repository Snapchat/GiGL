# GiGL: Gigantic Graph Learning

GiGL is an open-source library for training and inference of Graph Neural Networks at very large (billion) scale.

## Key Features üåü

- üß† **Versatile GNN Applications**: Supports easy customization in using GNNs in supervised and unsupervised ML
  applications like node classification and link prediction.

- üöÄ **Designed for Scalability**: The architecture is built with horizontal scaling in mind, ensuring cost-effective
  performance throughout the process of data preprocessing and transformation, model training, and inference.

- üéõÔ∏è **Easy Orchestration**: Simplified end-to-end orchestration, making it easy for developers to implement, scale, and
  manage their GNN projects.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

See [Installation Instructions](docs/user_guide/getting_started/installation.md)

## Getting Started üöÄ

If you like to get started right away, see our [Quick Start Guide](docs/user_guide/getting_started/quick_start.md)

The best way to get more familiar with GiGL is to go through our detailed [User Guide](docs/user_guide/index.rst) and
see our [API documentation](docs/api/index.rst)

### Architecture

GiGL includes a range of components, each built to support the platform‚Äôs end-to-end GraphML workflows. For an overview
of the architecture and detailed information, please refer to
[GiGL Components](docs/user_guide/overview/architecture.md). Below, we provide a brief summary for quick reference.

The figure below illustrates at a high level how components of GiGL work together.
(<span style="color:purple">Purple</span> items are work-in-progress.)

The figure below is a example GiGL workflow with tabularized subgraph sampling for the task of link prediction, in which
the model is trained with triplet-style contrastive loss on a set of anchor nodes along with their positives and
(in-batch) negatives.

### Usage

GiGL offers 3 primiary methods of usage to run the components for your graph machine learning tasks.

#### 1. Importable GiGL

To easily get started or incorporate GiGL into your existing workflows, you can simply `import gigl` and call the
`.run()` method on its components.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```python
from gigl.src.training.trainer import Trainer

trainer = Trainer()
trainer.run(task_config_uri, resource_config_uri, job_name)
```

</details>

#### 2. Command-Line Execution

Each GiGL component can be executed as a standalone module from the command line. This method is useful for batch
processing or when integrating into shell scripts.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```
python -m \
    gigl.src.training.trainer \
    --job_name your_job_name \
    --task_config_uri gs://your_project_bucket/task_config.yaml \
    --resource_config_uri "gs://your_project_bucket/resource_conifg.yaml"
```

</details>

#### 3. Orchestration

GiGL also supports pipeline orchestration using different orchestrators. Currently supported include local, and Vertex
AI (backed by Kubeflow Pipelines). This allows you to easily kick off an end-to-end run with little to no code.

See [Orchestration Guide](docs/user_guide/getting_started/orchestration.md) for more information

#### Configuration üìÑ

Before getting started with running components in GiGL, it‚Äôs important to set up your config files. These are necessary
files required for each component to operate. The two required files are:

- **Resource Config**: Details the resource allocation and environmental settings across all GiGL components. This
  encompasses shared resources for all components, as well as component-specific settings.

- **Task Config**: Specifies task-related configurations, guiding the behavior of components according to the needs of
  your machine learning task.

To configure these files and customize your GiGL setup, follow our step-by-step guides:

- [Resource Config Guide](docs/user_guide/config_guides/resource_config_guide.md)
- [Task Config Guide](docs/user_guide/config_guides/task_config_guide.md)

## Tests üîß

Testing in GiGL is designed to ensure reliability and robustness across different components of the library. We maintain
a wide collection of linting/formatting, unit, integration, cloud end-to-end integration tests, and large scale
performance testing.

One your PR is "Added to the merge queue", the changes will only merge once our CI
[runs these tests](https://github.com/Snapchat/GiGL/blob/main/.github/workflows/on-pr-merge.yml) and all of their status
checks succeed. The only caveat to this is the large scale performance testing that runs @ some regular cadence but is
not visible to open source users currently.

If you have an open PR; you can also manually kick off these CI tests by leaving one of the following comments:

**Note: For safety reasons you will have to be a repo maintainer to be able to run these commands. Alternatively, see
instructions on how to run the tests locally, or ask a maintainer to run them for you.**

Run all unit tests:

```
/unit_test
```

Run all integration tests:

```
/integration_test
```

Run all end-to-end tests:

```
/e2e_test
```

### Running tests locally

The entry point for running all tests is from the `Makefile`. We provide some documentation below on how you can run
these tests locally.

#### Lint/Formatting & Unit Tests

You can run all the linting & Formatting tests by calling

```bash
make check_format
```

You can run unit tests locally by calling

```bash
make unit_test
```

<details>
<summary>More Commands</summary>

```bash
# Runs both Scala and Python unit tests, and the python static type checker
make unit_test

# Runs just Python unit tests
make unit_test_py
# You can also test specific files w/ PY_TEST_FILES=<TEST_FILE_NAME_GLOB>. e.g.:
make unit_test_py PY_TEST_FILES="eval_metrics_test.py"

# Runs just Scala unit tests
make unit_test_scala

# Run the python static type checker `mypy`
make type_check

# Run all formatting/linting tests
make check_format

# Runing Formatting/Linting tests individually
make check_format_py
make check_format_scala
make check_format_md

# Try fixing all formatting/linting issues
make format

# Try fixing Individual formatting/linting issues
make format_py
make format_scala
make format_md
```

</details>

#### Local Integration Test

```{note}
This section will be updated soon. TODO (svij)
```

GiGL's local integration tests simulate the pipeline behavior of GiGL components. These tests are crucial for verifying
that components function correctly in sequence and that outputs from one component are correctly handled by the next.

<details>
<summary>More Details</summary>

- Utilizes mocked/synthetic data publicly hosted in GCS (see: [Public Assets](%22todo%22))
- Require access and run on cloud services such as BigQuery, Dataflow etc.
- Required to pass before merging PR (Pre-merge check)

To run integration tests locally, you need to provide yur own resource config and run the following command:

```bash
make integration_test resource_config_uri="gs://your-project-bucket/resource_config.yaml"
```

</details>

### Cloud Integration Test (End-to-End)

```{note}
This section will be updated soon. TODO (svij)
```

Cloud integration tests run a full end-to-end GiGL pipeline within GCP, also leveraging cloud services such as Dataflow,
Dataproc, and Vertex AI.

<details>
<summary>More Details</summary>

- Utilizes mocked/synthetic data publicly hosted in GCS (see: [Public Assets](%22todo%22))
- Require access and run on cloud services such as BigQuery, Dataflow etc.
- Required to pass before merging PR (Pre-merge check). Access to the orchestration, logs, etc., is restricted to
  authorized internal engineers to maintain security. Failures will be reported back to contributor as needed.

To test cloud integration test functionality, you can replicate by running and end-to-end pipeline by following along
one of our Cora examples (See: [Examples](%22todo%22))
